# rapid
My training project to make finding flat, rooms etc. faster and easier - it is called 'Rapid' hence.

## Architecture
For now it will be simple CRUD application to provide bascic functionality. Afterwards there will be more modules created.
Backend layer is in Spring 5 with Spring Boot 2 and frontend is in React JS with Typescript (it is type safe)
